## Folders Structure

This repository is organized into five main folders, each corresponding to a specific experiment or set of related experiments:

1. **Experiment-1: Calibration-1 Exercise Report**
   - Focuses on the harmonic oscillator model, parameter variation, noise analysis, and optimization using different methods like `fminsearch` and `fmincon`.
   
2. **Experiment-2: Calibration Exercise Report: Exploring Equation of Motion**
   - Explores equation of motion calibration with an emphasis on least squares and regularization techniques, particularly Tikhonov regularization.
   
3. **Experiment-3: Regularization Methods**
   - Compares classical matrix inversion techniques with various regularization methods including TSVD and iterative approaches.
   
4. **Experiment-4: Signal Analysis and System Identification**
   - Delves into signal processing techniques such as FFT, spectral power density, coherence functions, and wavelet transformations.
   
5. **Experiment-5: Damage Detection**
   - Focuses on detecting damage in structures by analyzing natural frequency responses and the effects of noise and damping.

Each folder contains the relevant code, data, and report files required for reproducing the results discussed in the corresponding sections.
